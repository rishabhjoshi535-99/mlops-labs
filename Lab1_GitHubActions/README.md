# Lab 1 – GitHub Actions for ML Automation
## Reference Lab
This lab is a reimplementation of GitHub_Labs → Lab2 from the course repository.
## Objective
The goal of this lab is to demonstrate how GitHub Actions can be used to automate
machine learning workflows such as model training and evaluation.
## Originality Statement
All code in this lab is written from scratch.
No scripts, workflows, or logic have been copied from the course repository.
Only the overall idea of automating ML tasks using GitHub Actions is reused.
## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- GitHub Actions
## Status
Folder structure initialized. Implementation will be added in the next steps

## Dataset and Model Selection

For this lab, the Iris dataset was selected for model training and evaluation.
The dataset is small, well-structured, and commonly used for introductory
classification tasks, which makes it suitable for demonstrating automation
rather than focusing on complex data preprocessing.

Logistic Regression was chosen as the classification model due to its simplicity
and interpretability. Since the primary objective of this lab is to showcase
GitHub Actions–based automation for machine learning workflows, a lightweight
and fast-training model helps keep the focus on the MLOps pipeline rather than
model tuning.

Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, which provides a clear and
straightforward measure of classification performance for this task.
