# Lab 1 – GitHub Actions for ML Automation
## Reference Lab
This lab is a reimplementation of GitHub_Labs → Lab2 from the course repository.
## Objective
The goal of this lab is to demonstrate how GitHub Actions can be used to automate
machine learning workflows such as model training and evaluation.
## Originality Statement
All code in this lab is written from scratch.
No scripts, workflows, or logic have been copied from the course repository.
Only the overall idea of automating ML tasks using GitHub Actions is reused.
## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- GitHub Actions
## Status
Folder structure initialized. Implementation will be added in the next steps
